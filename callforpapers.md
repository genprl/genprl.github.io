The workshop will focus on research related to all aspects of planning, learning, generalization, and transfer in sequential decision-making (SDM). This topic features technical problems that are of interest not only in multiple sub-fields of AI research (including reinforcement learning, automated planning, and learning for knowledge representation), but also in other fields, including formal methods and program synthesis. We welcome submissions that address formal and empirical issues on topics such as:



- Formulations and Representations of generalized SDM problems.
- Transfer and generalization in SDM.
- Hierarchy in SDM.
- Generalized policy representation, learning, synthesis, analysis, or certification.
- Neuro-symbolic approaches for generalization and transfer in SDM.
- Learning search heuristics, domain control knowledge, and partial policies for SDM.
- Theoretical aspects of planning and reinforcement learning.
- Learning for program synthesis.
- Meta-learning for generalizable policies.
- Few-shot learning and transfer for SDM.
- Reinforcement learning and planning competition(s).
- Multi-agent planning and learning.
- Applications of both reinforcement learning and planning.
